                    <p>Fatima left Aleppo with her children in August 2013 after their home was damaged by shelling. She has not heard from her husband, who remained behind in Syria to care for his elderly parents, for more than eight months. She and her seven children currently live in a single room in the Jordanian capital Amman. There is barely enough space to lie down at night, and they have no means of heating the room.</p>
                    <p> Three months ago, Fatima began receiving cash assistance of 120 Jordanian dinars (169 USD) per month from UNHCR, which covers most of the cost of her rent. </p><br >

                    <p>The cash assistance also means that her 10-year-old son Ali no longer has to spend up to six hours a day selling clothes at a local market to make extra money. He is now attending school and dreams of becoming a doctor.</p>
